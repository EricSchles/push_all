#Push All

The goal of this simple tool is to push all unpushed changes in all repositories on your file system.  I made this tool mostly because I am very lazy and often forget to update things.

##How to use

Using push all is very simple.  Simply pass it the root directory that you want to start pushing from and push_all.py will push everything up to github (assuming a repo already exists).

```
python push_all.py ~
```
